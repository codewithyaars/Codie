Module 3: Advanced HTML & Best Practices (Advanced)

Main Topics:

Accessibility (A11y) Deep Dive:

What is web accessibility and why is it crucial?

WAI-ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles, states, and properties (aria-label, aria-describedby, aria-hidden, role="button").

Keyboard navigation considerations.

Screen reader compatibility.

Semantic structure as the foundation for accessibility.

Contrast and color considerations (though primarily CSS, HTML structure helps).

Web Components (Introduction):

What are web components? (Custom Elements, Shadow DOM, HTML Templates).

Basic understanding of how to define and use a custom element.

Benefits and use cases.

HTML Templating & Reusability:

<template> and <slot> elements.

Server-side vs. Client-side templating (conceptual).

Using JavaScript to dynamically generate HTML.

Responsive Images (Advanced):

<picture> element for art direction and multiple image sources.

srcset and sizes attributes on <img> for resolution switching.

Optimizing image delivery for different devices.

Microdata & Schema.org (Introduction):

What are microdata and Schema.org?

Enhancing SEO with structured data.

Common types (e.g., Person, Product, Event, Article).

itemscope, itemtype, itemprop attributes.

Impact of DOM size on performance.

Internationalization (i18n) and Localization (l10n):

lang attribute on <html> and other elements.

dir attribute (ltr, rtl).

Character encodings (UTF-8).

HTML Validation:

Using W3C HTML Validator.

Why validate HTML? (Browser compatibility, debugging, best practices).

Capstone Project: Build an accessible, semantic, and performant multi-page website (e.g., an educational platform, an advanced portfolio with dynamic content, or an e-commerce product listing) demonstrating advanced HTML techniques, including accessibility features, responsive images, and a basic understanding of microdata.

Throughout the Course:

Hands-on Coding: Emphasize practical application with numerous coding exercises and small projects.

Best Practices: Regularly highlight semantic HTML, accessibility, and performance considerations.

Developer Tools: Introduce browser developer tools (Elements tab) for inspecting and debugging HTML.

Version Control: Briefly introduce Git/GitHub for saving and sharing code.

Real-world Examples: Show examples of well-structured HTML from popular websites.

Quizzes/Assessments: Regular checks for understanding.

Code Review: Opportunities for peer or instructor code review.

This course structure aims to provide a solid foundation in HTML for beginners and then progressively build towards advanced concepts and best practices required for professional web development.
